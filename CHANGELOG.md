## 2.0

    like native tooltips

## 1.3
- GitLab: bugs caused by a [recent change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/8f8f1a82564e49d4a233e3101954af0e27ac43dc)
  in native HTML have been fixed.

## 1.1
- CGit: clicking on userscript's link caused some content to "jump around" on
  the webpage, which has been corrected.
- GitLab: compatibility with fresh release of GitLab has been improved.
- GitLab: styling of tooltip "Copied to clipboard" has been updated to make it
  look more like GitLab's native tooltips.

  was annotated by the tag.  This has been fixed.
- CGit: support for `master` branch of CGit (as of 2023-08-29) has been added.
