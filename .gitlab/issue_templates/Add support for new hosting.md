### Is UI of this hosting provider a SPA?
<!-- SPA stands for "Single Page Application", which usually means support for
"on-the-fly" page reloads.  A simple Yes or No answer is enough.

If the answer is "Yes", the implementation would be more involved than for most
hosting providers.  For example, GitHub and Bitbucket Cloud don't trigger a
proper full page reload in browser when user navigates between commit pages.
See classes `GitHub` and `BitbucketCloud` for details.
